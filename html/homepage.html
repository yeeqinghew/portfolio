			<h2>Easy Management</h2>
			<p>Easy Management is CAPSTONE school project that was created to help EM Services to manage the progress claims among the various stakeholders involved in a particular project. This helps to assess and maintain the contractor's claims for work which has been deem as completed. While a progress claim for different projects requires different requirements, our system will allow this flexibility by creating multiple templates with subsections for ease of use. While claims are to be submitted progressively, we have introduced versions. These versions could be used to track various claims to a project and serve as a reference should there be any disputes or clarification required. </p>
